# Adversarial training with ResNet-50
Researching influence of adversarial training on AI model performance

TODO: Push code to personal repository, since I can't fork from BBK

## To Run
- Clone repository
- Download data from imagenet - 2015
- In the root directory, run `python -m venv .venv ` to create a virtual environment
- `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt -q`
- In VS code, select the kernel as the venv created earlier
